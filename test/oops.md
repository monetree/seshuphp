abstraction:it is nothing but hiding data using access specifier we can achive it.
encapsulation:combination of datamember and member function
is called encapsulation.class is a example of encapsulation.

child class.
parent:using this we can refer present class data into child class.
method declaration:function without body
method defination: function with body
interface:interface are defined to provide common function names to the implements.
to avoid defining method names we use interface.
all methods should be public inside ingterface.
implements:if you want to provide body for interface method we have to
body inside class by implementing or inheriting interface.from interface to keywords we have to use keyword implements.

abstract class:
an abstract class is one that can't be instantiated only inherited.
polymorphism:
if one thing exists in many form is called polymorphism.
method overloading:same method names in one class
method overriding:same method name in child class and parent class.
final:final is keyword to make the class final means we cant inherit that into child clas.
